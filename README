#	SOCKET PROGRAMMING USING DATAGRAM SOCKET	#

								Client.c
EXEC COMMAND:

DESCRIPTION:
	The file consists of 2 major steps:(2)getting socket descriptor and (3)sending/recieving of data packets
	
	1.First check if the arguments are -h or the required parameters to run program.
	  If neither display error message with help.
	2.First of all we get the address info of the server by using the provided IP address or the hostname.
	  Next get the socket descriptor.
	3.Get the file pointer to the file to write to.
	  Next make a loop for processing 50 datapackets.For each data packet
		Initialize a pkt type struct to Packet number,time of sending & RC value.
		Do while RC!=0
			Convert struct to required array of byte size(Argument given packet size)
			Send the packet using the address found in step 2
			Recieve the packet from the server in limited amount of time
			If delay time > threshold value 
				Assume packetloss and break loop
			Else
				Convert datapacket recieved to struct pkt
				decrement RC value by 1
		If packet not dropped
			Write the required values to file
		Else
			Write FAIL
	4.Delete the servinfo pointer.Close fileptr.Close socket file descriptor.


								Echo.c
EXEC COMMAND:

DESCRIPTION:
	The file consists of 2 major steps:(1)getting socket descriptor and (2)sending/recieving of data packets
	
	1.First of all we set server info using its own IP address.
	  Next get the socket descriptor using the server address info.
	  Bind server to the local port for listening.
	2.Wait for recieving some datapacket.
	  Continue till infinity(need to hard stop in terminal using CTRL+C)
			Recieve the packet from client
			Convert datapacket recieved to struct pkt
			decrement RC value by 1
			Convert struct to byte[] of maximumbuffer size
			Send the packet back to client using the client address stored when recieving
	3.Delete the servinfo pointer.Close socket file descriptor.
